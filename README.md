This is a fork of the official Builder plugin!

The official plugin: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/builder-citizens2

It took me some time on my usual work time so be generous if you support my work it would make me really happy and would encourage me a lot to maintain this plugin if you can donate me right here: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XUC36ZPAYUXGG&source=url
